- basic React + Vite app inspired by [Colt Steeles Web Dev Bootcamp (paid)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/37875726)

## training tasks (react)
- [x] use props
- [x] pass different javascript data types as props (string, nnumber, object, array) 
- [x] work with default prop values
- [x] use conditionals (render different frontend based on condition)
  - [ ] get comfortable with short circuits & ternary operators (used a lot in react)
- [ ] (get comfortable using react dev tools)
- [x] add **dynamic** styles to components, using style attribute (also look at react docs tutorial for reference)

  - [x] get comfortable working with `.map()` bc used a lot in react
- [x] [slot machine exercise](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/37875726)

## next up practice approach
- [ ] find small react basics exercises or prompt ChatGPT for some
- [ ] copy other peoples apps




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
